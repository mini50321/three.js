# Detailed Laboratory Procedure: Preparation of Potash Alum
## (Potassium Aluminium Sulphate - K₂SO₄·Al₂(SO₄)₃·24H₂O)

---

## **EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW**

**Aim:** To prepare double salt: Potash Alum (Potassium Aluminium Sulphate)

**Chemical Equation:**
```
K₂SO₄ + Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 24H₂O → K₂SO₄·Al₂(SO₄)₃·24H₂O
(Potash Alum)
```

**Theory:**
- A double salt is formed when equimolar proportions of potassium sulphate and aluminium sulphate are crystallized from their solution
- Al³⁺ ions undergo hydrolysis, so dilute sulphuric acid is added to prevent hydrolysis
- Slow cooling produces well-formed crystals

---

## **MATERIALS REQUIRED**

### **Apparatus:**
- Beaker (50 mL) - 1
- Glass rod - 1
- Tripod stand - 1
- Wire gauze - 1
- Bunsen burner or hot plate
- Funnel - 1
- Filter paper
- Trough (for cooling)
- Weighing balance

### **Chemicals:**
- Distilled water - 10 mL
- Aluminium sulphate [Al₂(SO₄)₃] - 6.6 g

## **DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE**

### **STEP 1: Preparation - Add Distilled Water**

**Action:**
- Take a clean, dry 50 mL beaker
- Using a measuring cylinder, measure exactly **10 mL of distilled water**
- Pour the water into the beaker
- Place the beaker on a tripod stand with wire gauze

**Why this step:**
- Distilled water ensures no impurities interfere with crystal formation
- Exact volume (10 mL) is important for proper concentration

**Student should verify:**
- Volume = 10 mL (±2 mL tolerance acceptable)

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Initial state: Beaker with 10 mL water at 20°C
- Student action: Drag/place beaker (already has water)
- Validation: Check volume = 10 mL

---

### **STEP 2: Heat Water to 40°C**

**Action:**
- Light the Bunsen burner or turn on the hot plate
- Place the beaker on the wire gauze over the flame
- Heat the water gently until it reaches approximately **40°C**
- Use a thermometer to monitor temperature
- Remove from heat once 40°C is reached

**Why this step:**
- Warm water (40°C) helps dissolve aluminium sulphate more easily
- Not too hot - we don't want boiling yet
- Temperature control is crucial for proper dissolution

**Student should verify:**
- Temperature = 40°C (±5°C tolerance acceptable)

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Student action: Use heat control to raise temperature
- Validation: Temperature rule (Target: 40°C, Tolerance: ±5°C)
- Visual: Water should show slight warming (color might change slightly)

---

### **STEP 3: Dissolve Aluminium Sulphate**

**Action:**
- Weigh exactly **6.6 g of aluminium sulphate** on a weighing balance
- Add the weighed aluminium sulphate powder to the warm water in the beaker
- Use a glass rod to stir the mixture continuously
- Stir until all the aluminium sulphate completely dissolves
- The solution should become clear (no visible particles)

**Why this step:**
- Aluminium sulphate is the first component needed for the double salt
- 6.6 g is the calculated amount for equimolar proportion
- Complete dissolution is essential before adding the next component

**Student should verify:**
- All solid has dissolved (solution is clear, no particles visible)
- Beaker contains the solution (hasContent check)

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Student action: Stir the beaker
- Validation: Custom condition - hasContent = true
- Visual: Solution should be visible in beaker
- Note: In real lab, student would add the powder; in virtual lab, we assume it's added when stirring

---

### **STEP 4: Add Dilute Sulphuric Acid**

**Action:**
- Using a dropper or pipette, carefully add approximately **0.4 mL of dilute sulphuric acid**
- Add it drop by drop while stirring gently
- Continue stirring to ensure uniform mixing
- The total volume should now be approximately 10.4 mL

**Why this step:**
- Al³⁺ ions undergo hydrolysis in water: Al³⁺ + H₂O → Al(OH)²⁺ + H⁺
- Adding dilute H₂SO₄ prevents hydrolysis by providing H⁺ ions
- This ensures proper crystal formation without unwanted precipitates
- **CRITICAL:** Without this step, crystals may not form properly

**Student should verify:**
- Volume increased to approximately 10.4 mL (±0.5 mL tolerance)
- Acid has been added (volume check confirms this)

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Student action: Pour action (simulating adding acid)
- Validation: Volume rule (Target: 10.4 mL, Tolerance: ±0.5 mL)
- Visual: Volume should increase slightly
- Safety note: In real lab, this requires careful handling

---

### **STEP 5: Add Potassium Sulphate**

**Action:**
- Weigh exactly **2.4 g of powdered potassium sulphate** on a weighing balance
- Transfer the weighed potassium sulphate powder to the beaker containing the aluminium sulphate solution
- The powder should be added all at once or in small portions
- Do not stir yet - just add the powder

**Why this step:**
- Potassium sulphate is the second component needed for the double salt
- 2.4 g is the calculated amount for equimolar proportion with 6.6 g Al₂(SO₄)₃
- The equimolar ratio is essential for proper double salt formation

**Student should verify:**
- Powder has been added (beaker contains the mixture)
- All components are now present

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Student action: Drag action (simulating transferring powder)
- Validation: Custom condition - hasContent = true
- Visual: Solution should still be visible (powder will dissolve in next step)

---

### **STEP 6: Heat and Stir Until Complete Dissolution**

**Action:**
- Place the beaker back on the wire gauze over the Bunsen burner
- Heat the solution gently while continuously stirring with a glass rod
- Heat until the temperature reaches approximately **60°C**
- Continue stirring until all potassium sulphate powder completely dissolves
- The solution should become clear and homogeneous
- Remove from heat once dissolution is complete

**Why this step:**
- Potassium sulphate is less soluble than aluminium sulphate
- Heating to 60°C increases solubility, allowing complete dissolution
- Constant stirring ensures uniform mixing and prevents local overheating
- Complete dissolution is essential - any undissolved solid will affect crystal quality

**Student should verify:**
- Temperature reached approximately 60°C (±10°C tolerance)
- All solid has completely dissolved (solution is clear)
- No visible particles remain

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Student action: Heat action
- Validation: 
  - Temperature rule (Target: 60°C, Tolerance: ±10°C)
  - Custom condition - hasContent = true
- Visual: Solution should be clear and uniform
- Important: Both temperature AND dissolution must be verified

---

### **STEP 7: Cool Slowly to Room Temperature**

**Action:**
- Remove the beaker from the heat source
- Place the beaker in a trough or on a heat-resistant surface
- **DO NOT** place in ice or cold water
- Allow the solution to cool naturally and slowly to room temperature (approximately 25°C)
- This cooling process should take 15-20 minutes
- **DO NOT** disturb or shake the beaker during cooling
- Cover the beaker with a watch glass to prevent contamination

**Why this step:**
- **CRITICAL:** Slow cooling is essential for good crystal formation
- Rapid cooling produces small, poorly-formed crystals
- Slow cooling allows large, well-formed crystals to grow
- Room temperature (25°C) is optimal for crystallization
- Disturbing the solution during cooling disrupts crystal growth

**Student should verify:**
- Temperature has decreased to approximately 25°C (±5°C tolerance)
- Cooling was slow (not instant - this is important!)
- Solution was not disturbed

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Student action: Drag action (simulating waiting/validation)
- Validation: Temperature rule (Target: 25°C, Tolerance: ±5°C)
- Message: "Solution must cool slowly to room temperature. Rapid cooling will reduce crystal quality."
- Visual: Temperature should decrease gradually over time
- Important: System should track that temperature decreased gradually, not instantly

### **STEP 8: Verify Crystal Formation**

**Action:**
- After cooling to room temperature, observe the beaker
- You should see **white crystals** of potash alum at the bottom of the beaker
- The crystals may be in the form of octahedral or cubic shapes
- The mother liquor (remaining solution) should be clear
- Crystals should be visible and well-formed

**Why this step:**
- Confirms successful formation of the double salt
- White color indicates pure potash alum
- Crystal formation proves the reaction was successful
- Well-formed crystals indicate proper procedure was followed

**Student should verify:**
- White crystals are visible in the beaker
- Crystals have formed (beaker contains solid product)
- Color is white (not colored impurities)

**Virtual Lab Implementation:**
- Student action: Drag action (simulating inspection)
- Validation: Custom condition - hasContent = true
- Message: "White crystals of potash alum should be visible"
- Visual: Liquid color should change to white (or crystals should be visible)
- Reaction: The system should detect that the reaction occurred (aluminium sulphate + potassium sulphate + water → potash alum)

## **ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE (Not in 8 Steps - Optional Washing/Drying)**

### **Step 9: Decant Mother Liquor (Optional)**
- Carefully pour off the mother liquor (remaining solution) without disturbing crystals
- Leave the crystals in the beaker

### **Step 10: Wash Crystals (Optional)**
- Add a small amount of 1:1 cold water and ethanol mixture
- Gently shake the beaker to wash the crystals
- This removes any sticking mother liquor

### **Step 11: Filter and Dry (Optional)**
- Filter the crystals using filter paper and funnel
- Press the crystals between folds of filter paper to dry
- Weigh the dried crystals to determine yield

## **CHEMICAL REACTIONS INVOLVED**

### **Main Reaction:**
```
K₂SO₄ + Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 24H₂O → K₂SO₄·Al₂(SO₄)₃·24H₂O
(Potash Alum - Double Salt)
```

### **Why Dilute Sulphuric Acid is Added:**
```
Al³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Al(OH)²⁺ + H⁺  (Hydrolysis - unwanted)
Adding H₂SO₄ provides H⁺ ions, shifting equilibrium left, preventing hydrolysis
```

---

## **IMPORTANT PRECAUTIONS**

1. **Temperature Control:**
   - Don't overheat - excessive heat can decompose the salts
   - Maintain 40°C for initial dissolution, 60°C for final dissolution

2. **Slow Cooling:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Must cool slowly for good crystals
   - Rapid cooling = poor crystal quality
   - Don't use ice or cold water bath

3. **No Disturbance:**
   - Don't shake or stir during cooling
   - Crystals need undisturbed environment to grow

4. **Complete Dissolution:**
   - Ensure all solids dissolve before cooling
   - Undissolved material affects crystal formation

5. **Equimolar Proportions:**
   - 6.6 g Al₂(SO₄)₃ and 2.4 g K₂SO₄ are in equimolar ratio
   - This is essential for double salt formation

6. **Acid Addition:**
   - Must add dilute H₂SO₄ to prevent hydrolysis
   - Without it, crystals may not form or may be impure

---

## **EXPECTED RESULTS**

- **Product:** White crystals of potash alum
- **Crystal Shape:** Octahedral or cubic
- **Color:** Pure white
- **Yield:** Depends on procedure quality (typically 60-80% theoretical yield)
- **Mother Liquor:** Clear solution remaining after crystal formation

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No crystals form | Too fast cooling, wrong proportions | Cool slowly, check amounts |
| Small crystals | Rapid cooling | Cool more slowly |
| Colored crystals | Impurities, overheating | Use pure chemicals, control temperature |
| Crystals dissolve | Solution too hot | Cool to room temperature |
| Poor yield | Incomplete dissolution, wrong proportions | Ensure complete dissolution, check amounts |
