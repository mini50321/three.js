# How to Do the Powder, Gas, and Smoke Experiment

## Step-by-Step Student Guide

This guide shows you exactly how to perform the experiment as a student.

---

## Step 1: Start the Experiment

1. **Open the experiment page** in your browser
   - The URL will look like: `experiment.html?id=exp_xxxxx`
2. **Click the "Start Experiment" button** (pink/purple gradient button in the sidebar)
3. The experiment will begin and show Step 1 instructions

---

## Step 2: Add a Beaker to the Scene

1. **Click the "Labware" button** (green/purple button in the sidebar)
2. A modal window will open showing available labware
3. **Find and click "Beaker"** in the list
4. The beaker will appear on the lab table in the 3D scene
5. **Close the labware modal** by clicking outside it or pressing ESC

**What you'll see**: A beaker appears on the lab bench. If the experiment has initial state configured, it may already contain liquid (acid).

---

## Step 3: Select the Beaker

1. **Click on the beaker** in the 3D scene
2. The beaker will be highlighted/selected
3. In the right sidebar, you'll see the **"Controls"** section appear

**What you'll see**: 
- The beaker is selected
- Sidebar shows: Temperature slider, Volume input, and new sections for adding chemicals

---

## Step 4: Add Acid (if not already present)

**Note**: If the beaker already has acid from initial state, skip to Step 5.

1. **Make sure the beaker is selected** (click on it if needed)
2. In the sidebar, find the **"Add Chemical"** section
3. **Select "Acid"** from the dropdown menu
4. **Type `50`** in the amount field (or leave default 50)
5. **Click the "Add" button**
6. The beaker should now show **red/pink liquid** (acid)

**What you'll see**: Red/pink colored liquid appears in the beaker.

---

## Step 5: Add Carbonate Powder

1. **Make sure the beaker is still selected**
2. In the sidebar, find the **"Add Powder"** section
3. **Select "Carbonate"** from the dropdown menu (it's selected by default)
4. **Type `10`** in the mass field (or leave default 10)
5. **Click the "Add" button**

**What you'll see**:
- **Red/pink liquid** (acid) at the top
- **White/gray solid cylinder** (powder) at the bottom of the beaker
- The powder appears as a solid material, not a liquid

---

## Step 6: Trigger the Chemical Reaction

1. **Make sure the beaker is still selected**
2. In the sidebar, find the **"Chemical Reaction"** section
3. **Click the "Check & Trigger Reaction" button** (orange button)
4. A message will appear showing the reaction status

**What happens**:
- Acid and carbonate react together
- **CO₂ gas** is created automatically
- **Gray smoke particles** appear above the beaker
- Smoke particles rise upward
- Status message shows: "Reaction occurred: Acid reacts with carbonate to produce carbon dioxide gas"

**What you'll see**: 
- Smoke particles rising from the beaker
- The beaker now contains gas (CO₂) in addition to the remaining liquid

---

## Step 7: Heat the Beaker

1. **Make sure the beaker is still selected**
2. In the sidebar, find the **Temperature slider**
3. **Drag the slider to 80°C** (or type 80 in the temperature display)
4. **Watch the smoke intensify**

**What happens**:
- Temperature increases
- More gas is produced
- Smoke effect becomes more intense
- Smoke particles rise faster and more visibly

**What you'll see**: 
- More smoke particles
- Faster rising motion
- More visible smoke effect

---

## Step 8: Observe Gas Escape

1. **Keep watching the beaker** - you don't need to do anything
2. **Observe the smoke** rising from the beaker

**What happens**:
- Gas volume decreases as it escapes (unsealed container)
- Smoke particles continue rising
- Container volume decreases over time
- Visual smoke effect continues while gas remains

**What you'll see**:
- Smoke particles rising and dissipating
- Over time, gas escapes and smoke eventually disappears when all gas is gone

---

## Step 9: Complete the Steps

1. **Follow the step instructions** shown in the "Current Step" section
2. **Click "Validate Step"** after completing each step
3. The system will check if you completed the step correctly
4. **Move to the next step** when prompted

## Visual Guide: What You Should See

### After Step 4 (Add Acid):
- ✅ Beaker with red/pink liquid (acid)

### After Step 5 (Add Powder):
- ✅ Red/pink liquid at top
- ✅ White/gray solid cylinder at bottom (powder)

### After Step 6 (Trigger Reaction):
- ✅ Smoke particles rising from beaker
- ✅ Gray particles moving upward
- ✅ Reaction message appears

### After Step 7 (Heat):
- ✅ More intense smoke
- ✅ Faster particle movement
- ✅ More visible smoke effect

### After Step 8 (Observe):
- ✅ Smoke continues rising
- ✅ Gas volume decreases over time
- ✅ Smoke eventually disappears when gas is gone

## Tips and Tricks

### Selecting Objects:
- **Click** on any object in the 3D scene to select it
- Selected objects show controls in the sidebar
- You can rotate the view by **dragging** with your mouse
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out

### Adding Chemicals:
- The **"Add Chemical"** section only appears when a container is selected
- You can add multiple chemicals to the same container
- Chemicals mix together in the container

### Adding Powders:
- The **"Add Powder"** section only appears when a container is selected
- Powders appear as solid cylinders at the bottom
- Powders can coexist with liquids in the same container

### Triggering Reactions:
- Click **"Check & Trigger Reaction"** to manually trigger reactions
- Reactions can also occur automatically when chemicals mix
- The status message tells you if a reaction occurred

### Heating:
- Use the **temperature slider** to heat containers
- Higher temperatures intensify smoke effects
- Some reactions require specific temperatures

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See the Beaker?
- Use mouse to **rotate the view** (drag)
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- Click **"Reset View"** button if available

### Controls Not Appearing?
- **Click on the beaker** to select it first
- Controls only appear when a container is selected

### Smoke Not Appearing?
- Make sure you **triggered the reaction** (Step 6)
- Check that both acid and carbonate are in the beaker
- Try **heating the beaker** to intensify smoke

### Powder Not Showing?
- Make sure you **added the powder** using the "Add Powder" button
- Check that the beaker is selected
- Powder appears as a solid cylinder at the bottom

### Reaction Not Working?
- Make sure both **acid and carbonate** are present
- Click **"Check & Trigger Reaction"** button
- Check the status message for errors

## Summary

**Quick Checklist:**
1. ✅ Start experiment
2. ✅ Add beaker from Labware
3. ✅ Select beaker
4. ✅ Add acid (if needed)
5. ✅ Add carbonate powder
6. ✅ Trigger reaction (creates gas + smoke)
7. ✅ Heat beaker (intensifies smoke)
8. ✅ Observe gas escape
9. ✅ Complete all steps
10. ✅ Validate each step

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- ✅ **Powder**: Solid material stored with mass, visualized as solid cylinder
- ✅ **Gas**: Created from reactions, escapes automatically, creates smoke
- ✅ **Smoke**: Appears when gas is present, intensifies with heat, disappears when gas is gone

Enjoy the experiment! 🧪
